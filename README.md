# BEACOIN
Beacoin is an offline payment system that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to enable cashless transactions. By emitting a 2.4GHz frequency that can be read by a phone's Bluetooth, Beacoin allows users to make payments without an internet connection.

To use Beacoin, users must first download the application and upload money online, which will be stored in their virtual wallet. Users can then use this cashless money to make payments at any shop or facility where a Beacoin beacon is located. The application scans for nearby beacons, displays shop information, and enables users to make secure payments with a PIN.

Beacoin is designed to be highly secure, using end-to-end encryption to prevent hacking. Since it is mostly offline, it is highly resilient to internet connectivity issues, making it ideal for use in areas with weak or no internet connections.
